This is a demonstration of tennis in a website! It was built using A-frame and a lot of Javascript.

# How to set up
1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/B-Eddie/A-Frame`
2. Open index.html in your browser in any way you want! There is no need for any installations or anything because it uses CDN's

## Way #2
